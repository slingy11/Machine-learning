Classification of Iris Dataset

Problem statement:
To perform classification analysis on Iris dataset. Perform any two classification algorithms and compare the accuracy.

Solution:
I first imported modules and loaded the dataset.Next, I deleted the unnecessary columns, shared some statistics about the dataset and I have checked for null values. Then I represented the data in the form of histograms and I have plotted scatterplots. Then, I have done label encoding to convert the data to machine readable form.
Then I did model training, with a train test ratio of 60:40. Next I have classified it using logistic regression and I got an accuracy pf 96.67 and I classified it using KNN classification and again got an accuracy of 96.67.
